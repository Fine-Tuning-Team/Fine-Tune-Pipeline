## ‚ú® Key Features Implemented

### 1. Automatic Integration
- ‚úÖ **Zero Setup Required**: Just run components normally, MLflow logging happens automatically
- ‚úÖ **Built-in Error Handling**: Components gracefully handle MLflow failures
- ‚úÖ **Automatic Cleanup**: MLflow runs are properly closed even if exceptions occur

### 2. Real-time Training Tracking
- ‚úÖ **Custom Callback**: `MLflowCallback` logs metrics during training in real-time
- ‚úÖ **Step-by-Step Logging**: Training loss, validation loss, learning rate tracked per step
- ‚úÖ **Training Events**: Logs epoch begin/end, training start/end, model saves
- ‚úÖ **Best Metrics**: Automatically tracks and logs best metrics achieved

### 3. Comprehensive Metrics
- ‚úÖ **Training**: Loss, learning rate, runtime, throughput, best metrics
- ‚úÖ **Inference**: Dataset size, inference time, samples per second, progress
- ‚úÖ **Evaluation**: All RAGAS scores, statistical summaries, timing metrics

### 4. Complete Artifact Logging
- ‚úÖ **Models**: Fine-tuned models, tokenizers, configurations
- ‚úÖ **Outputs**: Inference results (JSONL), evaluation reports (Excel, JSON)
- ‚úÖ **Metadata**: Environment info, configurations, run parameters

### 5. Robust Architecture
- ‚úÖ **Context Managers**: Proper MLflow run lifecycle management
- ‚úÖ **Type Safety**: Handles different dataset types and metric formats
- ‚úÖ **Error Recovery**: Components continue working even if MLflow fails
- ‚úÖ **Progress Tracking**: Real-time updates for long-running operations

## üöÄ How to Use

### Immediate Usage (No Changes Required)
Your existing code will now automatically include MLflow tracking:

```python
# This now includes automatic MLflow tracking
finetuner = FineTune()
finetuner.run()  # ‚úÖ MLflow logging automatic

inferencer = Inferencer()
inferencer.run()  # ‚úÖ MLflow logging automatic

evaluator = Evaluator()
evaluator.run()  # ‚úÖ MLflow logging automatic
```

### Configuration
Ensure your `config.toml` has MLflow settings:

```toml
[mlflow]
tracking_uri = "http://localhost:5000"
experiment_name = "fine-tune-experiments"
run_name = "my-experiment"
run_name_prefix = "ft"
run_name_suffix = "v1"
```

### Environment Variables
```bash
export MLFLOW_USERNAME="your-username"  # if auth required
export MLFLOW_PASSWORD="your-password"  # if auth required
```

## üìä What Gets Logged

### During Fine-tuning
- Real-time training metrics (loss, learning rate, etc.)
- Model configurations and hyperparameters
- Best metrics achieved during training
- Model artifacts and tokenizer files
- Training checkpoints (optional)

### During Inference

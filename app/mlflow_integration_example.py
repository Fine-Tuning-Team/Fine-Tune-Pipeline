"""
Example integration of MLflow reporter with FineTuner, Inferencer, and Evaluator.
This file shows how to integrate the MLflow reporter with each component.

Note: As of the latest updates, MLflow logging is now directly integrated into each component.
This file serves as an example of how to use the components with MLflow tracking.
